# Title: Personalized AI Chatbot – Generative AI & RAG-Based
# 1. Project Title & Description
Description:
A personalized AI chatbot that utilizes Generative AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to replicate individual behavior, intelligence, and conversational style. It is trained on personal data to provide context-aware responses and mimic human-like interactions.

# 2. Features
Personalized Conversations: Trained on user-specific data to mirror personal intelligence and behavior.
RAG-Based Retrieval: Uses a vector database to fetch relevant responses dynamically.
LLM Integration: Powered by Llama 3, through Groq.
Memory Retention: Remembers past interactions for improved responses.
Deployment Ready: Deployed on streamlit
# 3. Technology Stack
Backend: Python, Streamlit
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
AI Components:
Large Language Model (LLM) – (Llama 3, Groq)
Embeddings – Hugging Face 
Vector Database – Pinecone 
Document Loaders – PyMuPDF
APIs & Deployment: Streamlit

# Run the chatbot
streamlit run app.py  

# 4. How It Works
User Input Processing:
Accepts user queries and tokenizes the input.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):
Searches for relevant context from the personal dataset (via embeddings & vector DB).
LLM Response Generation:
Combines retrieved knowledge with LLM-generated responses.
Response Delivery:
Returns a human-like, personalized response.
# 5. Model Training & Fine-Tuning
Uses Hugging Face transformers for fine-tuning.
Embeds personal documents via Pinecone.
Fine-tunes responses based on user feedback & past interactions.

# 6. UI Overview
Dark-themed chatbot UI (HTML/CSS/JS).

# 7. Known Issues & Troubleshooting
LLM Not Responding? Check API key & rate limits.
Slow Response? Optimize embedding retrieval.
UI Not Loading? Check frontend dependencies.
# 8. Future Enhancements
Support for voice-based interaction.
More real-time memory capabilities.
Additional data sources for knowledge retrieval.
